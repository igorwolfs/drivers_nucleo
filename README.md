## Bare-Metal Driver for I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO on Nucleo Board

### Description:
This is a Github repository for an embedded software project that aims to develop bare-metal drivers for I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO on the Nucleo development board. The project is primarily intended to showcase the developer's skills and expertise in low-level programming.

The project is developed using the ARM Cortex-M architecture without making use of the CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) library provided by STMicroelectronics.

The main features of the project will include:

* Drivers for I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO, enabling communication and control of external devices and sensors.
* Low-level implementation of the drivers, providing efficient and reliable communication with minimal overhead.
* Example applications showcasing the usage of the drivers, including sensor readings, LED control, and serial communication.

The project is still in the early stages of development, and I intend to continue adding more features to it.
